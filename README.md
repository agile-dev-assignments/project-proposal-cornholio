# Project title

Fulfill



# What?
Fulfill is a web-based application where patients can submit their personal, medically relevant information to a secure database.

Doctors and medical professionals have a similar portal in which they can send a request-for-information that you can approve as an end-user.

This request would contain all the necessary information the doctor's office needs, no more or less, to be approved by you.



# Why and who?
This product is meant to reduce time spent filling out forms in the doctor's office (saving both patients and doctors time), 
prevent giving unnecessary information to a doctor who doesn't need it (different medical professionals require different and varying levels of information), and reduce paper waste.



# How?
There will be a patient as well as a medical professional portal.

The patient portal will host a patient's medical information,
while the medical professional portal will host approved requests for the doctors to reference.

A secure database that masks sensitive information would be required for both portals,
both from a privacy perspective, and from a medical compliance perspective.

A message system (likely an email push) would need to be created for situations such as a medical form requiring information that the user has not uploaded to their profile, or as a notification that a doctor has sent you a request, or as a confirmation for approval on either portal.
